# Frequency Analysis of Words

This script performs frequency analysis of words in the text file in any language. Words are not case sensitive, because the script translates all words to lowercase. The words `Hello` and `hello` are the same word.

The script takes 2 parameters:
+ ` - file` - input file with the text
+ ` - count` - —Åount of most frequent words to output to terminal, optional parameter, default value = 10

Sample text files:
+ Russian - [text_ru.txt](http://rgho.st/private/6Rt6yCrSm/e7bc678e2b5d03071c479cd7f6ebad5b)
+ English - [text_en.txt](http://rgho.st/private/67XLrChC5/a05850549b5a617ec6226b0ac3706119)
+ French - [text_fr.txt](http://rgho.st/private/6xjr98KPn/18baab36bacf761b3f3431b5d55f860e)

# Quickstart

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash
$ python lang_frequency.py -file=text.txt -count=7
List of most frequent words:
  the - 58
  to - 36
  i - 36
  and - 34
  she - 33
